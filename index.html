  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve heard about algorithms a lot. In this short article, I am going to a little bit talk about algorithms, their importance, etc. which will be the first post in my Algorithms series. If you follow the series, you will get familiar with different type of algorithms, old and classic ones, or new and heuristic ones. Just follow the series.</p>

<h2>What is an algorithm?</h2>

<p>An algorithm in simple language is a finite set of instructions for calculating a function. For example we are looking for a file in a folder, what we might do is, we start from beginning of the list, check each and every file until we find the file we want or reaching to the end of the list. This is an algorithm.</p>

<h2>Why we should learn them?</h2>

<p>Algorithms are actually ways to solve problems; but they are not the solution. By learning algorithms you will find methods that help you in solving problems. It is like [Data Structure] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure). If we consider data structure as a tool, algorithms will be manual that helps us to learn how to use those tools to do desired task.</p>

<h2>When shall I use specific algorithm?</h2>

<p>The solution and algorithm you choose for any given problem, depends to:</p>

<ul>
<li>The way you are looking at the problem and visualizing it</li>
<li>Run Time/Space limits</li>
<li>Input Size</li>
</ul>


<p>These are only key factors. There are lots of other factors that might play a key role in selecting an algorithm, such as data structure, etc. Maybe the last two factors are obvious, but let&#8217;s see how the first factor might play a key role. Consider the classic 8-Queen problem. In this problem we want to place 8 queens in a 8x8 chessboard in a way that none of them could attack others.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say we are going to solve it by placing one queen at a time in a way that it will not be able to attack previous queens we have placed. Once we reached to a place that we cannot find a place for this queen, we will return back and move the previous queen to another cell and then continue, until we reach to a result. In this way we are using <strong>backtracking</strong> to solve the issue.</p>

<p>But there is another way to look at the problem. Let&#8217;s say we will place 8 queens in 8 rows randomly. Then we start to move queens in a way to minimize the number of queens that can attach each other. Now we have turned the problem into <strong>optimization problem</strong>. So as you can see, they way you are understanding and visualizing a problem will play a key role in solving it and finding algorithm.</p>

<h2>How we can compare two algorithms?</h2>

<p>Well, if there are different algorithms to solve a problem, then there should be some ways to compare them (I&#8217;m genius). We usually compare two algorithms based on their <strong>time</strong> and <strong>space complexity</strong>. Time and space complexity are not indicating the exact amount of time/space are required to solve a problem; instead they indicate how the time/space requirements will grow when the problem size grows. Since we want to study how the time/space requirements will grow, then we don&#8217;t need to consider the exact equation of time/space complexity; We can just consider the biggest factor. Let&#8217;s see this in below simple example.</p>

<h3>Finding an item in an ordered list</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s say we have an ordered list of numbers with size <strong><em>n</em></strong> and we want to see if this list contains number <strong><em>x</em></strong> or not. We can use below ways to search for <strong><em>x</em></strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Algorithm 1:</strong> We will start from first item and compare it with <strong><em>x</em></strong>: if it is equal, then list contains this number, otherwise, we will go to next item until we reach end of the list or find <strong><em>x</em></strong> in the list.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithm 2 (Binary Search):</strong> We compare <strong><em>x</em></strong> with the middle item of the list. If <strong><em>x</em></strong> is larger than middle item, then we should be able to find it in the second half of the list and we can ignore the first one and vice versa. Once we find out on which part of the list we have to search for <strong><em>x</em></strong>, then we repeat the same step, compare <strong><em>x</em></strong> with the middle item of this new list (first/second half). We continue this until we find <strong><em>x</em></strong> or reaching to a list with size <strong><em>1</em></strong>.</p>

<p>As you can see, we usually using second algorithm to find items in ordered list. Now let&#8217;s see how we can compare the time complexity of these two algorithms. When we want to estimate time complexity, we count how many times a key action or block of actions will be repeated. Like in our example, how many times we should perform comparison to find out given list contains <strong><em>x</em></strong> or not. In order to eliminate role of <strong><em>x</em></strong> in our estimation, we consider the <strong>worth-case scenario</strong> such as list does not contain x.</p>

<p>In the algorithm 1, we need to do comparison <strong><em>n</em></strong> times in the worth-case (which is obvious). But what about algorithm 2? The answer is <strong><em>log n</em></strong> (when we are using <strong><em>log</em></strong>, we usually mean <strong><em>log</em></strong> in base <strong><em>2</em></strong>). If you check the algorithm, you will see at each step we will divide list into half, so the list size will change like: <strong><em>n</em></strong>, <strong><em>n/2</em></strong>, <strong><em>n/4</em></strong>, <strong><em>n/8</em></strong>, <strong><em>n/16</em></strong>, &hellip; . So in the worth-case we will continue up to <strong><em>log n</em></strong>. When we want to denote the time/space complexity, we usually use <em>big O</em>, and we will show it as <strong><em>O(n)</em></strong> or <strong><em>O(log n)</em></strong>. This mean we are just considering the most significant factor and we are neglecting the others. For example if you algorithms time complexity is polynomial like <strong><em>( n<sup>x</sup> + n )</em></strong>, then we can say the time complexity is equal to <strong><em>O( n<sup>x</sup> )</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Finding proper algorithm for a given problem could be challenging. Learning more algorithms will give us better vision and understanding, and we will be able to analyze problem from different aspects and find different algorithms to solve the problem. Time/space complexity enables us to compare algorithms and choose the best algorithm based on input size and other limitations.</p>

<p>This was an introduction about algorithms. In next articles we will see different type of algorithms and their pros and cons.  Also we will learn how to calculate time/space complexity and combine different algorithms with some heuristic functions in order to reduce complexity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To find out the virtual path, you can use below property of <code>HttpRuntime</code>:</p>

<pre><code>HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath

<p>And in order to resolve the URL to relative path to the site root, you can simply replace &#8220;~&#8221; with the value of <code>HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath</code> and you have your resolved path. Below you can find an extension class to <code>HttpServerUtility</code> that adds <code>ResolveUrl</code> method, and you can use <code>ResolveUrl</code> and <code>MapPath</code> of the <code>HttpContext.Current.Server</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes, you need to add new methods to a type, for example, when you are developing a website, you need to use <code>HttpUtility.HtmlEncode()</code> function to encode html and then dump it to screen. For example if you have a class called <code>Post</code> and this class has a property called <code>PostTitle</code>, then you need to do like below:</p>

<pre><code>Post p = Post.LoadPost();
ltPostBody.Text = HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(p.PostTitle);
</code></pre>

<p>But if we have a method in string class that does this for us, then life will be easier and we could use something like below:</p>

<pre><code>ltPostBody.Text = p.PostTitle.HtmlEncode();
</code></pre>

<p>One way to do this is to modify the <code>Post</code> class and change the type of <code>PostTitle</code> to a derived type that has <code>HtmlEncode</code> method. But this is not a solution. What if you couldn&#8217;t modify the <code>Post</code> class? Or what if you couldn&#8217;t create new derived type because it is sealed by author. Or lots of other scenarios.</p>

<p>The simple solution is, using extension methods. What is it? <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx">MSDN</a> says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Extension methods enable you to &#8220;add&#8221; methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.</p></blockquote>

<p>The advantage of extension methods are, they will be available on all objects derived from that type. So if you add an extension method to <code>string</code> class, then it will be available on all string objects. Let&#8217;s see how we will implement extension methods. Again <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx">MSDN</a> says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Extension methods are defined as static methods but are called by using instance method syntax. Their first parameter specifies which type the method operates on, and the parameter is preceded by the <code>this</code> modifier. Extension methods are only in scope when you explicitly import the namespace into your source code with a <code>using</code> directive.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let write our own extension method. First we will add new class as below:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Cheraq.Extensions
{
    public static class StringExtensions
    {
        // our methods will be defined here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we will define our extension method:</p>

<pre><code>public static string HTMLEncode(this string phrase)
{
    return HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(phrase);
}
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, our method should be <code>static</code>. Also if you see the parameter, it is so strange. The first parameter should be defined as below:</p>

<pre><code>this type-that-you-want-to-add-extension-method-to-it parameter-name
</code></pre>

<p>After that we will define our implementation of the function. When we want to use the function, we need to add using directive to import the namespace. When you import the namespace, the extension method will be available for all object derived from that type. Below image shows our extension method on the auto-complete window. You can see the icon of the extension method is different.</p>

<p><img src="http://cheraq.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ext-1.jpg" alt="HTMLEncode is an extension method, so it got a different icon." /></p>

<p>The usage of extension method is same as normal method of that type. You can even add extension method to sealed class. But this will not violate the principal of encapsulation, because extended methods cannot access private variable and methods in the type they are extending. Below you can find summary of some facts about extension methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extension methods can only access private variable and methods in the type they are extending!</li>
<li>You cannot use them to override methods of a class or interface</li>
<li>They have lower priority than instance methods defined in the type itself. In other words, compiler first looks into the instance methods; if did not find any method with same signature, then it will search in extension methods</li>
<li>Extension methods are brought into scope at the namespace level</li>
<li>If you do not have access to the code of the type that you are extending, then it is better to keep in mind that changes in that type might break the extension method</li>
</ul>
