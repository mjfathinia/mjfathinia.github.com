  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Usually when you want to make efficient JS class, you want to keep as much as you can in prototype, and define less instant 
specific methods. To do so, you will make something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>var Cell = function () {
    this.neighbors = new Array ( 8 );
    return {
        addNeighbor : _proxy( this.add , this )
    }
}

Cell.prototype.add = function ( cell , i ) {
    if ( this.neighbors [ i ] ) 
        return;
    this.neighbors [ i ] = cell;
    cell.addNeighbor ( this , ( i + 4 ) % 8 ) );
}

function _proxy ( fn , me ) {
    return function () {
        fn.apply ( me , arguments );
    }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here what we do is, we hide the class behind an object which provides some methods to modify the underneath class object. 
This is same as using interfaces in object oriented languages. The issue is, in JS we donâ€™t have access to 
that interface normally.</p>

<p>Here we have a cell for the grid, which can have 8 neighbors and it stores them in an array. When you add a cell to another 
cell as neighbor, it will also add it as neighbor to the passed cell. What happens here is, the last line will just expose 
the class object, instead of interface object we made which can lead to exposing unwanted information or methods.</p>

<p>One way to avoid that is, to store the interface object in a variable and use that as shown below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>var Cell = function () {
    this.neighbors = new Array ( 8 );
    this._interface_ = {
        addNeighbor : _proxy( this.add , this )
    };
    return this._interface_;
}

Cell.prototype.add = function ( cell , i ) {
    if ( this.neighbors [ i ] ) 
        return;
    this.neighbors [ i ] = cell;
    cell.addNeighbor ( this._interface_ , ( i + 4 ) % 8 ) );
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Note: This is just a quick fix for that issue, and it can also lead to other kind of issues, so
think about what you want to do, and how you want to protect your code.</strong></p>
